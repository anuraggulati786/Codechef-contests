 ******############  QUSTION :------->>>>     Chef has an array consisting of N+K−1 integers. The array contains only the first N positive odd numbers. Each number appears exactly once, except for one number which appears exactly K times. The sum of integers in Chef's array is equal to S.

For example, for N=3, K=2, the possible arrays could be [1,1,3,5], [3,1,3,5], [5,3,5,1]. For N=1, K=3, there is only one possible array: [1,1,1].

Chef gives you three integers N, K and S and asks you to find the only element which appears K times in his array.

It is guaranteed that for the given input, there exists a valid array consisting of N+K−1 elements with a sum exactly equal to S.

Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N,K,S.
Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing the integer which appeared K times in Chef's array.
